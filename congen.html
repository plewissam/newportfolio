    <p class="centerwrapperitem mid fadeInUp animated wow">BBTV's current contract system required sales teams to send links housed inside multiple Google Sheets. Not only were there mix-ups and duplicate contracts, scalability was an upcoming issue. As the UX/UI designer, I researched, analyzed, and designed the custom solution. I also worked closely with the developers to ensure that the design was technologically feasible. </p>

<section class="congen3 congensections centerwrapper">
<h2 class="wtext centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">Research</h2><br><p class=" wtext centerwrapperitem mid fadeInLeft animated wow">Research was crucial as the product affects BBTV’s main revenue stream - creating an ineffective solution would directly hit the company’s bottom line.  The best research came from shadowing the sales team members as it provided insight of how things currently work on a grassroot level. This allowed me to learn first hand about their problems and habits. </p>

<section class="congen4 congensections centerwrapper">
  <h2 class=" centerwrapperitemfadeInLeft animated wow">Analysis</h2><br><p class="centerwrapperitem mid fadeInLeft animated wow">Through the user research, I found out that the current solution was very disorganized as users had trouble finding the correct links in Google Sheets. Furthermore, I uncovered a new problem - the sales teams often had to email back and forth their clients and explain how to fill in the contracts. I created multiple user flows to explain to leadership the flaws in the current sales process and possible solutions.</p>

    <h2 class="wtext centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">Design Process</h2><br><p class="wtext mid centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">The design process of this project was broken into basic sketches, wireframes, and mockups. Each set was tested vigorously with the sales teams. Through their feedback, we revised the design numerous times to better suit their needs. Daily check-ins with developers ensured that designs were also technologically feasible.</p>

<section class="congen6 centerwrapper congensections">
<h3 class=" centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">Enter Your Own Data</h3><br><p class="centerwrapperitem mid fadeInLeft animated wow">By having the sales teams fill in the data, the need to email back and forth corrections was significantly reduced. Now all clients needed to do was to review and sign. </p>

  <h3 class=" centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">Simple Selector</h3> </h2><br><p class="centerwrapperitem mid fadeInLeft animated wow">The current solution was a series of links housed in a messy spreadsheet. In the new product, we created a simple filterable selector that let them easily choose their contract. </p>

<section class="congen6 centerwrapper congensections">
<h3 class=" centerwrapperitem fadeInLeft animated wow">Homepage History</h3> <br><p class="centerwrapperitem mid fadeInLeft animated wow">To go above and beyond, we made the homepage of the product to have a recent history of each contract sent out. This increased visibility and allowed the sales teams to follow-up any outstanding contracts. </p>
